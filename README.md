# blowgraph

This repository contains blowgraph, a graphing library that doesn't suck.

Well, to be fair it doesn't do /anything/ yet.

Unfortunately, all popular graph libraries (matplotlib, pyqtgraph, and everything else) appears to suck beyond measure. You can make pretty pictures in them! Well yes, if you read the source code â€” because their documentation is atrocious. And once you start reading the source code, it becomes clear that the people who made these libraries just suck at design.


Let's fix that.

This is WIP.
